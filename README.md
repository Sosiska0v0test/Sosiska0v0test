### :man_technologist: About me:

I am a novice web developer.<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30px">. My path to IT started back in school, where my favorite subject was Computer Science. After school, I decided to go further, and enrolled in the Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, majoring in Computer Science. At uni, I studied programming languages such as C, Python, C#, C++ and JavaScript, but most of all I was hooked on web development!
